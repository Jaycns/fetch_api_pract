<h4>Education</h4>
University Of Nigeria, Nsukka, Enugu
<p>â€¢	Currently a graduate from the department of Electronic Engineering. While in school I took trainings in Artificial Intelligence where I learnt about Classification Algorithms such as Convolutional Neural Network, K-Nearest Neighbors and SVM in classifying complex data.
</p>
<p>â€¢	Also learnt about the Confusion Matrix which is basically used in determining the accuracy of the classification. 
</p>
<p>            â€¢	I also have a slight experience in Control systems Engineering due to course works and a project in a Two-way Multi-Level Access Control System using Facial Recognition and RFID (Radio Frequency Identification)
</p>
<p>            â€¢	During my project, I used Python as the programming language in creating the Facial recognition System with the use of OpenCV library
</p>
            <h4>Communication</h4>
I try to make eye contact, listen attentively, and speak clearly so that whoever I am talking with understands what I am saying. I also try to keep in mind to be open-minded when I am communicating with others who are of a different background.
<h4>Leadership</h4>
I would describe my leadership style as direct, and leading by example. I enjoy delegating tasks and taking the lead on projects, but I also like to stay involved and inspire my team by showing that I'm working hands-on to help them, too.
